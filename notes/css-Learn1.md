**`box-sizing: border-box`**

 With box-sizing: border-box;, we can change the box model to what was once the “quirky” way, where an element’s specified width and height aren’t affected by padding or borders. This has proven so useful in responsive design that it’s found its way into reset styles. So border-box can help make responsive layouts more manageable.


**`clip-path: polygon()`**

You specify polygon you want to add the clipping you add clippings with x and y coordinates left to right.  Use [Clippy tool](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) to calculate it for you!
